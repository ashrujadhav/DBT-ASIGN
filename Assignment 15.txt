Using Subqueries with DML Commands.

1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one
customer into this table.

> create table Multicust as 
	
			(select * from salespeople 
				where Snum IN (select Snum 
				from orders 
				group by Snum 
				having count(distinct cnum) > 1));

2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.

> delete from customers where cnum NOT IN (select Cnum from orders); 


3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

> UPDATE salespeople 
	
	SET comm = comm + 0.20 
	
	WHERE Snum IN (select Snum from orders group by Snum having sum(amt) > 3000);
