Creating Tables and Indexes.

1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
Orders table quickly.

>  create index i_Onum on orders(Onum);
	select Onum, Odate from orders group by Odate;


2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
be unique (assume all current values are unique)?

>  alter table orders add constraint unique(Onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
grouped by date quickly.

> create index i_Snum on orders(Snum);
  
select Snum,Odate from orders group by Odate;


4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

>  alter table customers add constraint unique(Rating,Snum);
