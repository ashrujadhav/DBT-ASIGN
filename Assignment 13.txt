ASSIGNMENT NUMBER 13

Using the UNION clause

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”. 

ANS-->
select 'High Rating' AS type,cname,city,rating from customers
where rating >= 200

union

select 'Low Rating' AS type, cname,city,rating from customers
where rating <= 200

order by rating;



 
2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order. 

ANS-->
select sname as Name, snum Number from salespeople 
where snum in (select snum from orders  group by snum having count(*) > 1)
						UNION
select cname as Name, cnum Number from customers 
where cnum in (select cnum from orders  group by cnum having count(*) > 1);

 
3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first. 
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.) 

ANS-->
select snum from salespeople
group by city
having city = 'San Jose'
union
select cnum from customers
group by city
having city = 'San Jose'
union
select onum from orders
where odate = '1990-11-03';
